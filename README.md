Stevens Institute of Technology
Design 6 Term Project

Project summary: your task is to develop a generic survey/test taking system. The following system requirements must be met.
1) Develop a system that allows a survey/test to be entered, modified, stored, loaded, taken and tabulated/graded. 
2) A survey/test can be composed of any combination of: True/False, Multiple Choice, short answer, essay answer, matching, rank the choices. Each question can accept a single answer or if appropriate, multiple answers. Obviously a True/False question would not accept multiple answers. 
3) Some tests could have correct answers and therefore could be graded.
4) A results module should be developed that indicates the totals for a particular survey or test.
